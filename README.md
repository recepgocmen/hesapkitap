This project allows users to calculate their potential earnings based on their monthly investments and annual return rates.

# Reason for the Project

I created this project because AI applications tend to view this calculation as a complicated process and often limit the number of iterations allowed. Additionally, they sometimes provide inaccurate calculations.
